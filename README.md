# Facial Verification with a Siamese Network

This repository contains the implementation of a facial verification system using a Siamese Network. The project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates the process of building and training a Siamese Neural Network to verify facial identities.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for preparing facial image data for training.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of the Siamese Network architecture using popular deep learning frameworks.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Methods for training the network and evaluating its performance on facial verification tasks.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing the results, including accuracy and loss curves.
- **Usage:** Instructions on how to use the trained model for facial verification on new data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
